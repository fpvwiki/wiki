## Understanding Motor Labeling

A motor name can be confusing at first, but everything is meant to tell you something very specific about it. Lets break down and use [Emax PM1806-2300Kv Brushless Multi-Rotor Motor Set 1 CW 1 CCW][example] as an example.

* **Emax** - Motor manufacturer.
* **PM** - Plastic Motor (this is relatively new).
* **1806** - Mounting holes are **18mm** apart (and I'm not sure what **06** is)
* **2300Kv** - Motor [[KV]] number. 
* **CW** and **CCW** - Motors are often sold in sets of two which when connected in the same way to [[ESCs]] will spin in opposite directions.
