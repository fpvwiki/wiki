## Specifications

## Models

There are two Naze32 models being sold today: **6dof** and **10dof**. The only difference is that 10dof has includes Digital Compass (HMC5883L) and Barometer (MS5611) sensors. The 6dof version is generally about 50% the cost of 10dof.

**Please note** that often [[Flip32]] 10dof is being sold as Naze32 10dof version. While technically [[Flip32]] is nearly exact copy, technically it's not the same board.
