## Video Guides

### Binding a Variety of Receivers with the FrSky Taranis

<<YouTube(YTgGU3BMjPA)>>

> Binding Receivers can give folks some troubles if it's not don't just so. This video demonstrates how to bind:
>
> * FrSky X8r
> * [[FrSky D4R-II|FrSky D4R]]
> * FrSky D8R-II (Same as D8R-PLUS
> * FrSky D8FR-II HV
> * ASA Delta 8 (most difficult of the bunch if you're short of patience)

### Acro Naze32, Taranis, & D4R-II Telemetry Setup (CPPM)

<<YouTube(Q7KpBGDxZQ4)>>

> This video focuses on telemetry using a Taranis, [[D4R-II|FrSky D4R]], and Acro [[Naze32]]. It only configures RSSI and battery voltage. If this were a full [[Naze32]] instead of just an Acro [[Naze32]], then there would be more pieces of information available in telemetry.
