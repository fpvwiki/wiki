From the [eHow page](http://www.ehow.com/how_6327671_use-tip-tinner.html):

> A tip tinner is used to clean the soldering tip between and after soldering work. According to MG Chemicals, the tip tinner is a mixture of soldering powder and oxide-reducing compounds, and efficiently removes frozen flux and other compounds from the soldering tip. Tip tinner should be used after all soldering work, prior to storing the tip, to prevent the freezing of chemicals.
