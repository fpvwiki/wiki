## Understanding Motor Labeling

A motor name can be confusing at first, but everything is meant to tell you something very specific about it. Lets break down and use [Emax PM1806-2300Kv Brushless Multi-Rotor Motor Set 1 CW 1 CCW][example] as an example.

* **Emax** - Motor manufacturer.
* **PM** - Plastic Motor (this is relatively new).
* **1806** - Mounting holes are **18mm** apart. The **06** part has various meaning depending on the manufacturer. It could be the height of the motor's can OR the height of the stator inside.
* **2300Kv** - Motor [[Kv]] number. 
* **CW** and **CCW** - Clock and counter-clock wise rotation. Motors sometimes are sold in sets of two which when connected in the same way to [[ESC]]s will spin in opposite directions.
