The All-in-one design will give you the cleanest ,most wireless zmr250 build yet!

Comes assembled except for buzzer in case you dont want to use it or use a different one.

* 1.6mm thick,2oz copper PCB with black mask and white silkscreen graphics.
* Enig (Immersion Gold plated pins/pads and filled or tented vias. 
* 4 Sets of ESC power pads for each arm. ESC and motor signal pads top and bottom
* Main Battery pads on top and bottom of the board.Bottom to keep battery leads out of the way and protected. Ziptie holes with allow for secondary securing of the battery leads to help in hard crashes. 3S and 4S capable. 
* Wide uninterrupted power and ground plane to give the the highest current handling possible. The more copper on the plane with no traces restricting it,means the more power you can run on it without it starving motors/escs and heating up.. 
* On board motor/esc connection to FC. No need to run any wires from your esc to you Flight controller. A signal pad is located next to each esc power pad . Motor 1 also has ESC BEC5v power pad to power the flight controller. Also one AUX BEC pad off motor4. 
* Built in LC filter for FPV
* ON board (clean)filtered 5v 1A LM2940 regulator to power 5v FpV hardware with pads at each FPV component locations 
* Filtered 3S(12v) pads at front for camera,one for StpDWN reg and rear for VTX
Front(cam) mid(Polulu) and rear(VTX video pads
* (Compatible with POLULU regulator boards)Optional direct solder in pads/pin header to connect a POLULU step down or/and step up for 4s safe fpv operation. 4s pads for cam and rear for vtx
* Clean 5v powered Direct Solder/plug in compatible with MINIM OSD with all connections on board. MINIM setup for smooth operation with no text overlay issues. Pads on Pdb are igital side: 5v/gnd/rx/tx with additional rx and tx pads on board. Analog side:video in/video out/gnd
* Additional filtered AUX 5v output pins
* RSSI components built in (resistor,cap) to run RSSI from FRsky D4RII receivers into the minim osd. Pads for D4rII rssi and minim rssi on board. 
* On board pads/pinheader to run optional WS2812b Programmable RGB LED
strips. Can be programmed by Cleanflight to display multiple features like orientation,Various warnings,flight modes,stick input direction,lost model flashing,arming etc. 4 pads total .1 dATA IN to connect lead to naze32(rxpin5) + 3pads for direct plug in 3 wire lead LED strip(pwr,gnd,Data)
* On board front and back Leds on bottom of board.white front ,red rear. Can be turned on and of by solderjump pads. Comes in the off state,jump to light. Plcc2 or 1206 smd leds can be used. 
* On board piezo buzzer - pretty loud( not factory installed) up to user to solder on board.Buzzer can be mounted on top or bottom of pdb. Easy to solder pads that line up with NAZE32 and Flip32/Dragonfly32
* Slots for battery straps. 
* All pads to FC are strategically located to line up with naze32 in 90degree right orientation. Dragonfly32/flip32 lined up as well in its standard orientation just needing to solder your 90degree motor pin header under board facing in. 
* On board Vbat pads for FC directly in line with NAZE32,dragonfly32,flip32
* 6.3mm isolation around all screw/standoff holes as well as no copper around arm mounting area to prevent any possible shortcircuts. 
* Camera pads and front esc pads moved as far away as needed from camera mounting area so they don't come in contact with cam. 
* QR code printed on board (smartphone scannable) bringing instant access this page with links to all info.
