## Angle Mode

## ESC

<img src="/uploads/esc-generic.jpg" width="150" align="right" />An electronic speed control or [[ESC]] is an electronic circuit with the purpose to vary an electric motor's speed, its direction and possibly also to act as a dynamic brake. ESCs are often used on electrically powered radio controlled models, with the variety most often used for brushless motors essentially providing an electronically generated three phase electric power low voltage source of energy for the motor.

## Flight Controller (FC)

<img src="/uploads/flight-controller-generic.jpg" align="right" /> A Flight Controller (FC) is a small circuit board of varying complexity. Its function is to direct the RPM of each motor in response to input. A command from the pilot for the multi-rotor to move forward is fed into the flight controller, which determines how to manipulate the motors accordingly.

The majority of flight controllers also employ sensors to supplement their calculations. These range from simple gyroscopes for orientation to barometers for automatically holding altitudes. GPS can also be used for auto-pilot or fail-safe purposes. More on that shortly.

See [[Flight Controllers]] for more information.

## FPV

First-person view (FPV), also known as remote-person view (RPV), or simply video piloting, is a method used to control a radio-controlled vehicle from the driver or pilot's view point. Most commonly it is used to pilot an unmanned aerial vehicle (UAV) or a radio-controlled aircraft.

## NTSC

[NTSC](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/NTSC) is the video system or standard used in North America and most of South America. In NTSC, 30 frames are transmitted each second. Each frame is made up of 525 individual scan lines. PAL is the predominant video system or standard mostly used overseas.

## OSD

## PAL

[PAL](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/PAL), short for Phase Alternating Line, is a colour encoding system for analogue television used in broadcast television systems in most countries broadcasting at 625-line / 50 field (25 frame) per second.

### Pitch

Pitch changes the vertical direction the aircraft's nose is pointing. 

### Roll

Roll affects how the craft is tilted side to side.

### Yaw

The yaw angle of the multirotor describes its bearing.

## TVL

[Television lines](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Television_lines) (TVL) is defined as the maximum number of alternating light and dark vertical lines that can be resolved per picture height. A resolution of 400 TVL means that 200 distinct dark vertical lines and 200 distinct white vertical lines can be counted over a horizontal span equal to the height of the picture.

Important to note that higher TVL on cameras doesn't translate into higher picture quality in the FPV context. The image captured with 800 TVL camera that is translated in NTSC format will be displayed at 525 scan lines (PAL is 625). 

## Tx

## UBEC

A Universal Battery Elimination Circuit, or UBEC, allows you to regulate the voltage of your battery down to another voltage. They are commonly used to provide 5V for flight controllers and radio receivers.

Available in 3V, 5V, 6V, 7V, 9V and 12V, UBEC's are commonly used to power additional gear on your craft like lighting systems, video transmitters and cameras from your flight battery.
