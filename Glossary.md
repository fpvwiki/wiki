## Flight Controller (FC)

<img src="/uploads/flight-controller-generic.jpg" align="right" /> A Flight Controller (FC) is a small circuit board of varying complexity. Its function is to direct the RPM of each motor in response to input. A command from the pilot for the multi-rotor to move forward is fed into the flight controller, which determines how to manipulate the motors accordingly.

The majority of flight controllers also employ sensors to supplement their calculations. These range from simple gyroscopes for orientation to barometers for automatically holding altitudes. GPS can also be used for auto-pilot or fail-safe purposes. More on that shortly.

See [[Flight Controllers]] for more information.

## UBEC

A Universal Battery Elimination Circuit, or UBEC, allows you to regulate the voltage of your battery down to another voltage. They are commonly used to provide 5V for flight controllers and radio receivers.

Available in 3V, 5V, 6V, 7V, 9V and 12V, UBEC's are commonly used to power additional gear on your craft like lighting systems, video transmitters and cameras from your flight battery.
