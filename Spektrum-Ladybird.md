# Spektrum DSM2 ladybird v1/v2 & 939

[[_TOC_]]

This is a new board that has been created as an exact drop in, in place of the ladybird/v939 board in order for your quad to be controlled using a DSM2 Spektrum Transmitter to fly the ladybird/v939. See the [RC Groups thread](http://www.rcgroups.com/forums/showthread.php?t=1745470) for more info.
