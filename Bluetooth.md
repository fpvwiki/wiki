# Bluetooth

TODO: WIP

Boards like [[Naze32]] and [[Flip32]] support an external Bluetooth module which lets you interact and configure your [[Flight  Controller]] via a phone application.

## Configuring The Bluetooth Module

* If you have `HC-05` module you'll need pin 34 of the modu.le high to enter AT mode.
* If you have `HC-06` module, as long as it's not paired via BT, you should be in AT mode without having to do anything special.
