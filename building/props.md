## [5 inch prop tests, at hover power][5_inch_test]

> After I tested the maximum thrust and efficiencies of several 5 inch mini quadcopter props, viewers suggested that I test them again at hover-power levels, so I did and here are the results.
>
> It looks as if the Gemfan 5030 and 5040 props still put in a credible performance but the efficiency crown goes to the 5x3 carbon prop, closely followed by an ABS 6045 that I threw in just for comparison.
>
> The HQ 5030 loses on efficiency but it is stronger than the Gemfans and the HQ 5045 bullnose props still show the effects of those very draggy wide tips, putting in the least efficient run.
