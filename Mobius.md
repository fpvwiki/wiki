## Wide Angle vs Regular

[[/uploads/mobius-lens.jpg]] 

Mobius comes in two flavors:

1. Regular ~85 degree lens (on the right)
2. Wide angle ~120 degree lens (on the left)

Each lens can be purchased separately and replacing existing lens is a matter of a few screws, unplugging existing lens and plugging in the new one. Could be done in under 5 minutes.

## FPV Setup

Mobius could be used as the recording and FPV camera at the same time if plugged in directly into the video transmitter.

The USB pinout is very straightforward and pretty much any USB type B mini connector could be adapted for this purpose.

### How to Build a Mobius Actioncam Power Cable with Video Out

<<YouTube(u9uD3X6-ndQ)>>

> This video was a build request from some local flyers who fly Mobius cameras in their rigs and needed a way to plug them into an onboard power source to supplement the camera's internal battery. I take it a step further and show you how to enable video out mode on the Mobius so you can use this as either a flight camera or in a 2 camera rig (using a video switcher).
