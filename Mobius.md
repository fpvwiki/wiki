### How to Build a Mobius Actioncam Power Cable with Video Out

<<YouTube(u9uD3X6-ndQ)>>

> This video was a build request from some local flyers who fly Mobius cameras in their rigs and needed a way to plug them into an onboard power source to supplement the camera's internal battery. I take it a step further and show you how to enable video out mode on the Mobius so you can use this as either a flight camera or in a 2 camera rig (using a video switcher).
