Batteries make your multirotor fly, plain and simple. Before we get any further...

## Safety

**LiPo fires are real!!** Please read the [Complete Guide to Lithium Polymer Batteries and LiPo Failure Reports](http://www.rcgroups.com/forums/showthread.php?t=209187). Do it now! LiPo batteries can set your house on fire if mishandled (also kill your teddy bear). When you fly and crash all the time, your batteries get beaten pretty hard. **Always check for any sign of puffiness.**

## What Are All These Numbers?

Each LiPo battery in RC hobby comes with three very important numbers on it:

1. **mAh rating**. This is milliamperes per hour. This basically determines how much juice the battery. You can also guesstimate the size and weight because larger MAH means physically larger battery.
2. **Number of cells**. Each cell in a LiPo battery is 3.7V and a 2 cell battery is 7.4V, 3 cell is 11.1v and so on.
4. **C rating**. This is the most mysterious one of them all and alot of people are generally confused here.

## Video Guides

### Parallel Charging

<<YouTube(WY194Md6KNg)>>

This video explains the benefits of parallel charging LiPo batteries. It does not cover LiPo battery basics. It is recommended that you are familiar with LiPo selection and charging before attempting parallel charging.

When charging batteries SAFETY is critical. The usual precautions apply:

* Do not charge batteries unattended.
* Charge in a safe place (fireproof bag or box is recommended away from flammable materials).
* Parallel charging is safe; however, the following additional precautions apply:
  * NEVER connect batteries of different voltages together in parallel. Make sure that all the batteries are the same cell count and voltage.
  * Be aware that once batteries are connected together in parallel, if something does go wrong there is more energy stored in the batteries which in the worst case could damage multiple battery packs and damage property through fire.
