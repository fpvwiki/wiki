# Motor Kv

The KV motor value is is one of the key attributes when picking the right motor. According to [Wikipedia](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Motor_constants):

> Kv is the motor velocity constant, measured in RPM per volt. The Kv rating of a brushless motor is the ratio of the motor's unloaded RPM to the peak (not RMS) voltage on the wires connected to the coils (the back-EMF). For example, an unloaded motor of Kv, 5,700 RPM/V, supplied with 11.1 V, will run at a nominal 63,270 RPM (5,700 RPM/V Ã— 11.1 V).

If that doesn't make sense to you, I don't blame you. Think of it this way, if a motor is rated at 1000 Kv and you give it 12V, then 12,000 RPM is the peak RPM it will reach.

### Rule Of Thumb

How does this relate to you? Lets define some basic guiding principles for picking the right Kv based on your application:
