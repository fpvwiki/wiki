# Frame

[[_TOC_]]

There are many types of multirotor frames ranging from one off builds with woods sticks to very complex and expensive carbon fiber flying machines costing tens of thousands of dollars. Somewhere at the very beginning of this spectrum hobby multirotor frames live ranging from about $20 to maybe $200. Generally made out of strong materials like carbon fiber they are designed and assembled to take a pretty good beating. This is especially true for the [[FPV]] racing 250 format.

The number (eg 250, 300, 450) in the frame model generally indicates the size of the frame, more specifically the diagonal distance between motors.
